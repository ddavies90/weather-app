# Weather App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Deployed on Heroku at http://weather-app-dd.herokuapp.com/

## Description

This project aims to teach the basics of React via the creation of a weather app. The app queries the API hosted at https://mcr-codes-weather-app.herokuapp.com and returns the data in the form of a 5 day forecast. 

## Installation

Clone down or fork the repo and run npm i to install all relevant dependencies. Also deployed to Heroku for remote use.

## Usage

To run locally, run npm start in the terminal. Once the app has been launched, either remotely or locally, enter a UK city name in the search box at the top right of the app to query the basic weather information for that location for the next 5 days.
